"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Albert Einstein

An instinct for simplicity is one of the most important traits of a software engineer.  It guides us to make code more robust, and easier to read.  This blog is about my search for simplicity in my code, as I look for the best possible solutions and the most elegant architectures.  In the words of one of my mentors, "coding is about finding out fundamental truths about the universe." 

My name is Greg Lee, and I'm an iOS and Android developer.  I've written production apps in both platforms.  In another life, I trained as a mechanical engineer at Stanford with a focus on Mechatronics.  After working in medical devices for a couple of years, I decided to make the switch to software, and I haven't looked back.  I'm passionate about software architecture, and I love finding the right abstraction.  On this blog, you'll find my attempts to compare the basic abstractions in iOS and Android, to discover where they differ, and to determine which worked better.  Life is a learning process, so please don't hesitate with any feedback or suggestions either through comments or via email.  

Also, I have a couple of sections devoted to two passions of mine, whitewater kayaking and photography.  Enjoy!
