"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Albert Einstein

An instinct for simplicity is one of the most important traits of a software engineer.  It guides us to make code more robust, and easier to read.  This blog is about my search for simplicity in my code, as I look for the best possible solutions and the most elegant architectures.  In the words of one of my mentors, "coding is about finding out fundamental truths about the universe." Life is a learning process, so please don't hesitate with any feedback or suggestions either through comments or via email.  

Also, I have a couple of sections devoted to two passions of mine, whitewater kayaking and photography.  Enjoy!
